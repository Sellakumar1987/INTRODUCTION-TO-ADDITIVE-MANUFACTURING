# INTRODUCTION-TO-ADDITIVE-MANUFACTURING

### 3D printing allows for rapid prototyping and onsite manufacturing of products. Initially done with plastic, 3D printing now uses new techniques with new materials, such as aluminum, bronze, and glass. Biomaterials are also being incorporated, such as 3D printing ear cartilage and liver tissue. As the 3D printing industry grows, 3D printing will become a big part of many engineering fields Introduction:- 3D printing allows for rapid prototyping and onsite manufacturing of products.

## Components of 3D Printer
## Axes
### Fixed Rods The three axes that the 3D printer utilizes are on the Cartesian coordinate system. The linear fixed rods are maintained at right angles to each other and each represents a coordinate axis. 
### The timing belts and pulleys allow the movement of the hot end (or the print bed, depending on the type of 3D printer) along each axis according to the g-code (generated by slicing software). The stepper motors power this movement.

## Extruder
### Extrusion is the feeding of filament into the hot end of the 3D printer. This movement is also powered by a stepper motor. Retraction mechanism is the pulling of melted filament from the hot end. This movement is primarily programmed through the g-code to prevent the formation of unwanted filament creating a bridge between two areas. The bridging of unwanted filament is referred to as stringing or the formation of cobwebs.

## Dual Extrusion 
### Some models of 3D printers are equipped with dual extrusion capabilities. This allows for mixed material objects to be printed. Dual extrusion can be used to print out complex objects with a different colour material as the support, making it easy to differentiate between the object and the support.

## Hot End
### The hot end is heated to temperatures ranging from 160 C to 250 C, depending on the type of filament to be used. The hot end melts  the  filament  and  pushes  the  melted filament through the nozzle. The hot end needs to be thermally insulated from the other components of the 3D printer to prevent any damage.

## Print Bed
### Heated Print beds that are heated  improve print quality of 3D printed objects. The heated bed is heated to the glass transition temperature of the filament being used. This allows the model layers to slightly melt and stick to the heated bed. Non-Heated Print beds that are not heated require adhesion in the form of glue, tape, hairspray, etc. In the innovation lab, painters tape is frequently used for adhesion.

## Filament
### Filament is a consumable used by the 3D printer to print layers. Filament comes in a variety of materials and colors. Filament  can be composed of metal,  wood,  clay, biomaterials, carbon fiber, etc.

###   I.	ABS: - ABS is a thermoplastic that needs to be heated to temperatures from 210 C to 250C. ABS can only be printed on a 3D printer with a heated bed, which prevents the cracking  of the object. When ABS is heated, it emits a strong unpleasant odor. ABS requires a complete enclosure while printing.
###   II.	PLA:  -  PLA is a thermoplastic  that needs to be heated to temperatures  from  160C to 220C. PLA is also biodegradable and emits slight odors. PLA is most frequently used in the Innovation Lab on all 3D printers

###   PVA PVA is a water soluble plastic that is frequently used for support in dual extrusion 3D printers.  The printed object is left in water where the PVA support is dissolved and the finished object printed in the other filament remains.

##  Preparing your 3D Model in CAD Software
### CAD software is used to create 3D models and designs. This  software  is available  on our computers and the level of difficulty varies. With the exception of Sketch up Pro  and  the industry standard software mentioned, all of these programs are available on the innovation lab computers.
### Solid works main idea is user to create drawing directly in 3D or solid form. From this solid user can assemble it directly on  their  workstation  checking clashes and functionality of it. Creating a drawing is pretty easy just drag and drop the solid to the drawing block.

## Preparing your 3D Model for print in Idea maker software
### These are following step for 3D printing of model
###   1. Install the 3D print software idea maker
###   2. Check repair option in this software
###   3. Set the nozzle parameter and build tack temperature according to the printer guide
###   Step:-1 Prepare the design Model using Designing Software(Solids Work, Autocad etc.)
###   Step:-2 Convert the designed Model file in Stl ,obj format.
###   Step:-3 Prepare the design model for printing Using Software Idea Maker and Ultimaker. Then set all parameter (nozzle temp., build task temp and support) and also repair your design using software option. Then after generate the file in geode format
###   Step:-4 ON the 3D Printer and load the filament in nozzle and give the command print by using 3D Printing Machine.

## Precaution of 3D Printer machine
### These are some following precaution when you print the design in 3D Printer
###   1. Mechanical: Do not place limbs inside the build area while the nozzle is in motion. The printer nozzle moves in order to create the object.
###   2. High Temperature: Do not touch the printer  nozzle  -it is heated  to a high temperature in order to melt the build material.
###   3. Always buy replacement parts from the manufacturer for safety related equipment
###   4. Choose an area that has adequate ventilation and exhaust capability
